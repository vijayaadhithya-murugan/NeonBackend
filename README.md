# Application Form Project

This project is an application form-based system with a Neon PostgreSQL backend and a frontend interface. 

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main folders:
- `backend` - Contains the backend application which interacts with the Neon PostgreSQL database.
- `frontend` - Contains the frontend application for interacting with users.

## Backend Setup

The backend of the project is built using Node.js. To set up and run the backend, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `backend` folder:

    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the backend server:

    ```bash
    node app.js
    ```

The backend will now be running and should be accessible based on the configuration in `app.js`.

## Frontend Setup

The frontend is built with a modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Vue, etc.). To set up and run the frontend, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `frontend` folder:

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

The frontend application will now be running and can be accessed in your web browser. The exact URL will be displayed in the terminal after running the command.

## Configuration

### Backend

Ensure you have the correct environment variables set up for connecting to the Neon PostgreSQL database. These are typically defined in a `.env` file or similar configuration file.

### Frontend

The frontend application may need to be configured to point to the correct backend server URL. Check the configuration files or environment variables for the appropriate settings.
